# LOCADER
_A Realtime Location Identification & Alerting System_

## Abstract
This prototype is a reliable and an easy-to-operate application for location sharing, messaging and emergency location trigger. The said prototype uses a microcontroller with IoT technologies to formulate a comprehensive solution for the problem at hand. The central idea is to make it much more intuitive and seamless to know the location of any family member at any given duration while they have access to the internet connectivity for the GPS tracking.

The solution is twofold, one being the app which would use the Thunkable framework to provide the location of the user with pinpoint accuracy. There are multiple users that can sign up to the app and join one family circle where each otherâ€™s whereabouts can be accessed easily. Alongside this, there is also a chat system within the app which can be used by all the members within the same family circle for general conversations. The app also incorporates the provision that triggers a message to the registered numbers with the location in case of emergencies.

The other aspect of the solution being the hardware which showcases the locations based on a few predefined entries made by the user. The LEDs are controlled by the microcontroller and are pre-set based on the most probable locations that the user regularly visits, including college, home, gym and more depending on that particular individual and family circle. Now when the member of the family reaches in the vicinity of the location that has been entered using the app, the corresponding LED would glow for the user, as each user has the LEDs for every frequently visited location.

The temperature, humidity, date and time are also displayed on the LCD using the corresponding sensors and data from the internet in order to have additional benefits within the
same setup. So, this entire system would not only be able to tell the location of the family members in real time but also incorporates several other critical features to make it user friendly and drastically improve its real-world applications when it is deployed.

PS: The name Locader is derived from "Location Detection and Emergency Response".
